============================================
Building:

NOTE: "src\smb_chr.chr" is required to assemble. (Not included.)

Run either build.bat, or build_debug.bat

They both will build the .nes rom, but one will also output debug data. 
(Try it and load the rom in NintendulatorDX and step through the code.)
Clean.bat will just delete all files in that could be created by either build.bat
in this default layout: There is no make/makefile.

In the bin folder is a fairly recent build of cc65 binaries for win32 with
a copy of ca65.exe built by thefox with MSVS2012 with some optimizations that
speeds up the assembly time. It requires the included msvcr110.dll file. 

This will/should still work with any recent build of cc65 as well, this modified 
ca65 is included because it is a bit (a lot) quicker.
