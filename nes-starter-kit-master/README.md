# NES Starter Kit 

A Beginner's Guide and toolkit for NES game creation.

## What is this?

It's a fully-fledged starter kit for NES games. It is the source to a top-down adventure game, alongside all of the 
tools needed to change it. It also comes with a guide to changing everything about it, which could also be titled
"The dummy's guide to creating an NES game".

The idea is, download this (either via git or a zip file), set up the tools, run the game, then tweak it and make
your own! With the right hardware, you can even play your game on your own NES.

The only thing this is *not* is an introduction to programming - if you have never programmed anything before, I
suggest finding a tutorial online for C or C++, and getting a couple really basic programs working. (At the
very least, find out what a "hello world" program is, and write+run one successfully.) 

One options is the [Learn C Tutorial](http://www.learn-c.org/) - it lets you write and run your code in the 
browser, so you don't need to set anything up! 


## Related projects

There are a few other projects worth knowing about that might be a better fit for your task.

First off, there's the upcoming NESMaker project. This has not yet been released, but it is a full-blown
gui for building games. Check out the [NESMaker website](http://www.thenew8bitheroes.com/)! This project is 
a good fit if you don't quite want to get your hands dirty with code. You may be able to edit the resulting
code, but it will likely be in assembly language, and a little harder to pick up if that is new to you.

In a similar vein, if you'd like a way to do that with Gameboy games, look into my ClassicGB project. It's a 
code-free web-based game builder. It also exports C source code, in case you want to extend it yourself! Check
that out on [the ClassicGB website](http://game-builder.cpprograms.net)!

Lastly, if you want something more barebones, I also have nes-c-bootstrap - it is a simpler "Hello World"
project that you can use for more of a blank page. That project is elsewhere 
[on Github](https://github.com/cppchriscpp/nes-c-boilerplate).

# Table of Contents

This guide is broken into 4 main chapters: 

1. Getting Started
2. Making it Your Own
3. Adding new features
4. Adding Polish
5. Advanced topics.

The suggested approach is to follow along with all of part 1 in order to get yourself familiar with
the console/tools/etc. After that, feel free to jump around to whatever chapters interest you. 

The second part mainly focuses on core things you will want to change to make your own game. Art, music
gameplay and more!

The third part focuses on how you can extend the game further. Want to give the main character a weapon?
Add some new features to the start menu? Do something else unique? This has guides and pointers on how to
do it!

The fourth part focuses on more cosmetic things - don't be afraid to get into these chapters early; 
sometimes adding a little bit of polish can really help encourage you to continue working on the game.

The final part deals with more advanced topics - for most simple games, you won't need to read 
anything in this section. It gets into depth on details of how the library itself works, as well as the 
system, and how the rom is organized. That said, these topics are here if you need them, or for that 
matter if they interest you.
